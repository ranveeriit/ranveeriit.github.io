My course on NPTEL [Introduction to Algebraic Graph Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwovrA6709I)

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Indore. At present, I am the head of the department. 

"Everybody understood that if the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed"- [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) (The mad monk of maths)

I have a huge regard for mathematics (the queen of sciences), and mathematicians (I am very far from being one). They are the best contributor to humanity, often silent yet elegant, they are always well ahead of the present time, the world follow them later. They have their own [challenges and frustration](https://www.isid.ac.in/~rbb/imsgen.pdf)  nicely explained by mathematician [RB Bapat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Bapat).   


# Research Interests
I broadly work in algebraic graph theory, that is, the study of graphs using the matrices associated with graphs like adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, Seidel matrix, etc. In addition I work in quantum computing.   


# Ongoing project under me
- Reducing parameterized complexities of matrix determinants and permanents.
- Construction of expanders and Ramanujan graphs for fast network topologies.
- Community detection in large networks.
